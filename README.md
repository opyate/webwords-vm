TODO this is wip. Quickly testing it on a clean laptop first...

# webwords cookbook

There are a lot of [new examples](http://typesafe.com/activator/templates) up on the Typesafe website, a few with the word "Reactive" in them to drive home the [credo](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) behind the framework. One of my favourite examples, however, seem to have been demoted but still remains one of my favourites: [webwords](https://github.com/typesafehub/webwords).

[The old Heroku link](http://webwords.herokuapp.com/) to the live running instance of webwords does not seem to be up anymore, so I whipped up a quick cookbook with which to spin up your own local instance.
